User manual:
1) In folder html_books are books that need to be parsed from html to txt. Use Python script fromHTMLtoTXT.py. Some books need to be manually cleaned after that.
2) Then to save indexes of character appearances use Java file Characters.java. The books are in books folder and indexes are saved in indexes folder
3) The distances between characters are computed in characterDistances.py script using indexes from index folder. The distances are saved in distance folder.
4) The accuracy matrix is calculated in classification.py script. This script will also save all Rips diagrams in folder images.
